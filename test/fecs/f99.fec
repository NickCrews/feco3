Denton County Republican Victory Fund [in its Amended May Monthly (4/1/18-4/30/18)] reported an increase in disbursements totaling $29,390.11 from the amounts disclosed on our original report because a post-filing review by the Denton County Republican Party�s newly appointed First Vice Chair - Finance identified the following clerical mistakes / omissions from the originally filed report:
