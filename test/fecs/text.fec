TEXTC00580100.TEXTF3PAThe Committee has reviewed all reimbursements to individuals for travel and subsistence and confirms that no further itemization is required under any Commission regulations for these expenditures. Checks were voided either because services were never rendered or they represent duplicate charges. Any difference between Reimbursement live entries and their supporting memo entries constitutes disbursements to vendors that do not exceed the $200 itemization threshold for the election cycle and are not required to be itemized per Commission regulations. Non-travel advances made and reimbursed within the reporting period are disclosed with memo itemization if payments to any vendor exceed the $200 threshold. Disbursements to vendors below the threshold are unitemized and constitute the difference, if any, between the live entry and the memo entry.
