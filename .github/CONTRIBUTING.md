# Contributing

I would love to have your help. If your idea is a new feature or
requires changing the API (ie is more than a bugfix or tweak)
then please open an issue first so we can discuss it. I don't
want you to waste your time writing a PR that I then decide
to reject because it doesn't fit the project.

Unless you state otherwise, all contributions will be
licensed under the MIT license.
